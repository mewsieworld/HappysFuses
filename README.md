hiiiiii :)  
i'm mewsie! (some of you from epTO might know me as mewzie or happy, which was my fuse creator name.)

i have a pretty foundational belief that information was meant to be free. so: i'm releasing my fuses for free, and i'll be updating them here as i make more.  
anyone can use these -- commercial, private, personal projects, whatever.  
i don't expect credit -- it's the internet, we steal things here -- but if you do or don't give credit, i just ask that you do it respectfully.

## what you'll find here in this branch:

*   prepped .nri files ready to import
